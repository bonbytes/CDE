# Description
This repository not only offers useful files and plugins regarding tmux, but also offers a (slightly) changed .bashrc for correct coloring in micro. 
Also, there are bash-scripts to install micro (awesome text-editor, best in class for console development. Beats vim and nano) and needed packages (or at least, recommended) for BOGY development

## Usage
tmux-resurrect has to be stored in ~/tmux folder to function properly.
<br/><br/>
.tmux.conf is a user config-file for tmux. You have to copy it to ~/ to be automatically detected by tmux.
<br/><br/><br/>
.bashrc is the bash init script for your user (pi). It is called when a new bash is spawned.
